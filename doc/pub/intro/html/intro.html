<h2 id="___sec3">Why is computing comptence important? </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>Definition of computing.</b>
<p>
With computing I will mean solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical, analytical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing algorithmic thinking when solving problems.
</div>

<h2 id="___sec4">Computing competence, what is it? </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Computing competence has always been a central part of the science and engineering education. Traditionally, such competence meant mastering mathematical methods to solve science problems - by pen and paper.

<p>
Today you are expected to use all available tools to solve scientific problems; computers primarily, but also pen and paper.

<p>
I will use the term/word algorithms in the broad meaning:  methods (for example mathematical) to solve science problems, with and without computers.

<h2 id="___sec5">What is computing competence about?  </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Computing competence is about

<ol>
<li> derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms</li>
<li> understanding what can go wrong with algorithms</li>
<li> overview of important, known algorithms</li>
<li> understanding how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems</li>
<li> reproducible science and ethics</li>
<li> algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="___sec6">Continuous verse discrete </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
Algorithms involving pen and paper are traditionally aimed at what we often refer to as continuous models.

<p>
Application of computers calls for approximate discrete models.

<p>
Much of the development of methods for continuous models are now being replaced by methods for discrete models in science and industry, simply because much larger problem classes can be addressed with discrete models, often also by simpler and more generic methodologies. However, verification of algorithms and understanding their limitations requires much of the classical knowledge about continuous models.

<h2 id="___sec7">Shift from classical mathematics to modern computing? </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>

<ol>
<li> The impact of the computer on mathematics is tremendous: science and industry now rely on solving mathematical problems through computing.</li>
<li> Computing increases the relevance in education by solving more realistic problems earlier.</li>
<li> Computing through programming is excellent training of creativity.</li>
<li> Computing enhances the understanding of abstractions and generalization.</li>
<li> Computing decreases the need for special tricks and tedious algebra, and shifts the focus to problem definition, visualization, and "what if" discussions.</li>
</ol>

The result is a deeper understanding of mathematical modeling. Not only is computing via programming a very powerful tool, it also a great pedagogical aid.
For the mathematical training, there is one major new component among the arguments above: understanding abstractions and generalization. While many of the classical methods developed for continuous models are specialized for a particular problem or a narrow class of problems, computing-based algorithms are often developed for problems in a generic form and hence applicable to a large problem class.

<h2 id="___sec8">Key principle in scientific modeling </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a particular problem.

<h2 id="___sec9">Computing competence is central to solving scientific problems </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b>Definition of computing.</b>
<p>
Computing competence represents a central element in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to essentially almost all advanced problems in modern societies. Computing competence is simply central to further progress. It enlarges the body of tools available to students and scientists beyond classical tools and allows for a more generic handling of problems. Focusing on algorithmic aspects results in deeper insights about scientific problems.

<p>
Today's project in science and industry tend to involve larger teams. Tools for reliable collaboration must therefore be mastered (e.g., version control systems, automated computer experiments for reproducibility, software and method documentation).

<h2 id="___sec11">Symbolic calculations and numerical calculations in one code  </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">
<b></b>
<p>
The following simple example here illustrates many of the previous points. 
Python offers an  extremely versatile programming  environment, allowing for
the inclusion of analytical studies in a numerical program. Here we show an
example code with the <b>trapezoidal rule</b> using <b>SymPy</b> to evaluate an integral and compute the absolute error
with respect to the numerically evaluated one of the integral
\( 4\int_0^1 dx/(1+x^2) = \pi \):
<p>


<div class="compute"><script type="text/x-sage">
from math import *
from sympy import *
def Trapez(a,b,f,n):
   h = (b-a)/float(n)
   s = 0
   x = a
   for i in range(1,n,1):
       x = x+h
       s = s+ f(x)
   s = 0.5*(f(a)+f(b)) +s
   return h*s

#  function to compute pi
def function(x):
    return 4.0/(1+x*x)

a = 0.0;  b = 1.0; n = 100
result = Trapez(a,b,function,n)
print "Trapezoidal rule=", result
# define x as a symbol to be used by sympy
x = Symbol('x')
exact = integrate(function(x), (x, 0.0, 1.0))
print "Sympy integration=", exact
# Find relative error
print "Relative error", abs((exact-result)/exact)

<h2 id="___sec12">Error analysis </h2>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-block alert-text-normal">

<p>
The following extended version of the trapezoidal rule allows you  to plot the relative error by comparing with the exact result. By increasing to \( 10^8 \) points one arrives at a region where numerical errors start to accumulate.
<p>


<div class="compute"><script type="text/x-sage">
from math import log10

from sympy import Symbol, integrate
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# function for the trapezoidal rule
def Trapez(a,b,f,n):

   s = 0
   x = a
   for i in range(1,n,1):
       x = x+h
       s = s+ f(x)
   s = 0.5*(f(a)+f(b)) +s
   return h*s
#  function to compute pi
def function(x):
    return 4.0/(1+x*x)
# define integration limits
a = 0.0;  b = 1.0;
# find result from sympy
# define x as a symbol to be used by sympy
x = Symbol('x')
exact = integrate(function(x), (x, a, b))
# set up the arrays for plotting the relative error
n = np.zeros(9); y = np.zeros(9);
# find the relative error as function of integration points
for i in range(1, 8, 1):
    npts = 10**i
    result = Trapez(a,b,function,npts)
    RelativeError = abs((exact-result)/exact)
    n[i] = log10(npts); y[i] = log10(RelativeError);
plt.plot(n,y, 'ro')
plt.xlabel('n')
plt.ylabel('Relative error')
plt.show()

The last example shows the potential of combining numerical algorithms with symbolic calculations, allowing you thereby  to

<ul>
<li> Validate and verify  your  algorithms.</li> 
<li> Include concepts like unit testing. It gives you the possibility to test and validate several or all parts of the code.</li>
<li> Validation and verification are then included <em>naturally</em> and you can develop a better attitude to what is meant with an ethically sound scientific approach.</li>
<li> The above example allows you to test the mathematical error of the algorithm for the trapezoidal rule by changing the number of integration points. You get to think error analysis from day one.</li>

The conventions and techniques outlined here will save you a lot of time when you incrementally extend software over time from simpler to more complicated problems. In particular, you will benefit from many good habits:

<ol>
<li> New code is added in a modular fashion to a library (modules)</li>
<li> Programs are run through convenient user interfaces</li>
<li> It takes one quick command to let all your code undergo heavy testing</li> 
<li> Tedious manual work with running programs is automated,</li>
<li> Your scientific investigations are reproducible, scientific reports with top quality typesetting are produced both for paper and electronic devices.</li>
