    "## Overarching aims of this course\n",
    "  * Develop a critical approach to all steps in a project, which methods are most relevant, which natural laws and physical processes are important. Sort out initial conditions and boundary conditions etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This means to teach you structured scientific computing, learn to structure a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A critical understanding of central mathematical algorithms and methods from numerical analysis. In particular their limits and stability criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Always try to find good checks of your codes (like solutions on closed/analytical form)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * To enable you to develop a critical view on the mathematical model and the physics.\n",
