===== Overarching aims of this course, how to develop and finalize a numerical project =====
!bblock
While developing the mathematical tools and a numerical project we aim at giving you an
insight in how to:
  * Develop a critical approach to all steps in a project, which methods are most relevant, which natural laws and physical processes are important. Sort out initial conditions and boundary conditions etc.
  * To teach you structured scientific computing and learn to structure a project using for example object orientation.
  * To give you a critical understanding of central mathematical algorithms and methods from numerical analysis. In particular their limits and stability criteria.
  * To show you how to use version control software to keep track of different versions of your normal project, how to verify and validate your codes and how to make your science reproducible. We will demonstrate this using "git":"https://git-scm.com/" and "github":"https://github.com"

===== Why is computing comptence important? =====
!bblock   Definition of computing    
With computing I will mean solving scientific problems using computers. It covers numerical, analytical as well as symbolic computing. Computing is also about developing an understanding of the scientific process by enhancing algorithmic thinking when solving problems.
!eblock


!split
===== Computing competence, what is it? =====
!bblock 
Computing competence has always been a central part of the science and engineering education. Traditionally, such competence meant mastering mathematical methods to solve science problems - by pen and paper. 

Today you are expected to use all available tools to solve scientific problems; computers primarily, but also pen and paper. 

I will use the term/word algorithms in the broad meaning:  methods (for example mathematical) to solve science problems, with and without computers.
!eblock



!split
===== What is computing competence about?  =====
!bblock   
Computing competence is about

o derivation, verification, and implementation of algorithms
o understanding what can go wrong with algorithms
o overview of important, known algorithms
o understanding how algorithms are used to solve mathematical problems
o reproducible science and ethics
o algorithmic thinking for gaining deeper insights about scientific problems
!eblock


!split
===== Continuous verse discrete =====
!bblock  
Algorithms involving pen and paper are traditionally aimed at what we often refer to as continuous models. 

Application of computers calls for approximate discrete models. 

Much of the development of methods for continuous models are now being replaced by methods for discrete models in science and industry, simply because much larger problem classes can be addressed with discrete models, often also by simpler and more generic methodologies. However, verification of algorithms and understanding their limitations requires much of the classical knowledge about continuous models.
!eblock



!split
===== Shift from classical mathematics to modern computing? =====
!bblock  
o The impact of the computer on mathematics is tremendous: science and industry now rely on solving mathematical problems through computing.
o Computing increases the relevance in education by solving more realistic problems earlier.
o Computing through programming is excellent training of creativity.
o Computing enhances the understanding of abstractions and generalization.
o Computing decreases the need for special tricks and tedious algebra, and shifts the focus to problem definition, visualization, and "what if" discussions.

The result is a deeper understanding of mathematical modeling. Not only is computing via programming a very powerful tool, it also a great pedagogical aid.
For the mathematical training, there is one major new component among the arguments above: understanding abstractions and generalization. While many of the classical methods developed for continuous models are specialized for a particular problem or a narrow class of problems, computing-based algorithms are often developed for problems in a generic form and hence applicable to a large problem class.
!eblock



!split
===== Key principle in scientific modeling =====
!bblock
The power of the scientific method lies in identifying a given problem as a special case of an abstract class of problems, identifying general solution methods for this class of problems, and applying a general method to the specific problem (applying means, in the case of computing, calculations by pen and paper, symbolic computing, or numerical computing by ready-made and/or self-written software). This generic view on problems and methods is particularly important for understanding how to apply available, generic software to solve a particular problem.
!eblock


!split
===== Computing competence is central to solving scientific problems =====
!bblock   Definition of computing    
Computing competence represents a central element in scientific problem solving, from basic education and research to essentially almost all advanced problems in modern societies. Computing competence is simply central to further progress. It enlarges the body of tools available to students and scientists beyond classical tools and allows for a more generic handling of problems. Focusing on algorithmic aspects results in deeper insights about scientific problems.

Today's project in science and industry tend to involve larger teams. Tools for reliable collaboration must therefore be mastered (e.g., version control systems, automated computer experiments for reproducibility, software and method documentation).

!bblock 
In this course we will try to focus on how to 

* Introduce Research based teaching  from day one
* Trigger further insights in math and other disciplines 
* Validation and verification of scientific results, with the possibility to emphasize ethical aspects as well. Version control is central.
* Introduce good project handling  practices from day one.

===== Symbolic calculations and numerical calculations in one code  =====
!bblock 
The following simple example here illustrates many of the previous points. 
Python offers an  extremely versatile programming  environment, allowing for
the inclusion of analytical studies in a numerical program. Here we show an
example code with the _trapezoidal rule_ using _SymPy_ to evaluate an integral and compute the absolute error
with respect to the numerically evaluated one of the integral
$4\int_0^1 dx/(1+x^2) = \pi$:
!bc pyscpro
from math import *
from sympy import *
def Trapez(a,b,f,n):
   h = (b-a)/float(n)
   s = 0
   x = a
   for i in range(1,n,1):
       x = x+h
       s = s+ f(x)
   s = 0.5*(f(a)+f(b)) +s
   return h*s

#  function to compute pi
def function(x):
    return 4.0/(1+x*x)

a = 0.0;  b = 1.0; n = 100
result = Trapez(a,b,function,n)
print "Trapezoidal rule=", result
# define x as a symbol to be used by sympy
x = Symbol('x')
exact = integrate(function(x), (x, 0.0, 1.0))
print "Sympy integration=", exact
# Find relative error
print "Relative error", abs((exact-result)/exact)
!ec
!eblock




!split
===== Error analysis =====
!bblock 
The following extended version of the trapezoidal rule allows you  to plot the relative error by comparing with the exact result. By increasing to $10^8$ points one arrives at a region where numerical errors start to accumulate.
!bc pyscpro
from math import log10
import numpy as np
from sympy import Symbol, integrate
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# function for the trapezoidal rule
def Trapez(a,b,f,n):
   h = (b-a)/float(n)
   s = 0
   x = a
   for i in range(1,n,1):
       x = x+h
       s = s+ f(x)
   s = 0.5*(f(a)+f(b)) +s
   return h*s
#  function to compute pi
def function(x):
    return 4.0/(1+x*x)
# define integration limits
a = 0.0;  b = 1.0;
# find result from sympy
# define x as a symbol to be used by sympy
x = Symbol('x')
exact = integrate(function(x), (x, a, b))
# set up the arrays for plotting the relative error
n = np.zeros(9); y = np.zeros(9);
# find the relative error as function of integration points
for i in range(1, 8, 1):
    npts = 10**i
    result = Trapez(a,b,function,npts)
    RelativeError = abs((exact-result)/exact)
    n[i] = log10(npts); y[i] = log10(RelativeError);
plt.plot(n,y, 'ro')
plt.xlabel('n')
plt.ylabel('Relative error')
plt.show()
!ec

===== Integrating numerical mathematics with calculus =====
!bblock 
The last example shows the potential of combining numerical algorithms with symbolic calculations, allowing you thereby  to
* Validate and verify  your  algorithms. 
* Include concepts like unit testing. It gives you the possibility to test and validate several or all parts of the code.
* Validation and verification are then included *naturally* and you can develop a better attitude to what is meant with an ethically sound scientific approach.
* The above example allows you to test the mathematical error of the algorithm for the trapezoidal rule by changing the number of integration points. You get to think error analysis from day one.

===== Additional benefits: A structured approach to solving problems =====
!bblock 
In this process we easily bake in
 o   How to structure a code in terms of functions
 o   How to make a module
 o   How to read input data flexibly from the command line
 o   How to create graphical/web user interfaces
 o   How to write unit tests (test functions or doctests)
 o   How to refactor code in terms of classes (instead of functions only)
 o   How to conduct and automate large-scale numerical experiments
 o   How to write scientific reports in various formats (LaTeX, HTML)
!eblock


!split
===== Additional benefits: A structure approach to solving problems =====
!bblock 
The conventions and techniques outlined here will save you a lot of time when you incrementally extend software over time from simpler to more complicated problems. In particular, you will benefit from many good habits:
 o New code is added in a modular fashion to a library (modules)
 o Programs are run through convenient user interfaces
 o It takes one quick command to let all your code undergo heavy testing 
 o Tedious manual work with running programs is automated,
 o Your scientific investigations are reproducible, scientific reports with top quality typesetting are produced both for paper and electronic devices.

===== Installing C++ and Fortran =====
!bblock
If you wish to use C++ or Fortran, we recommend normally 
* C++: Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like "Qt":"https://www.qt.io/ide/" which works on all platforms
* C++: Use the IDE "Visual C++":"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/60k1461a.aspx"  for Windows as operating system or "Dev C++":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/".
* For Mac (OSX) and linux users the "GNU gcc and gfortran":"https://gcc.gnu.org/"  family of compilers are  widely used.
* "The Intel C++ and Fortran compilers":"https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/01/03/free-intel-c-compilers-for-students-and-related-parallel-programming-tools" are excellent. Free versions exist for students. 
!eblock


!split
===== Installing and running python =====
!bblock
* For Linux and OSX users python is included by default. Check which version by typing  in a terminal window
!bc cppcod
python -v 
!ec
Additional packages may have to be installed. For OSX users I highly recommend installing python and additional packages using "brew":"http://brew.sh/". This makes it extremely simple to add packages and install additional software. With brew there is no point for OSX users to use virtual machines. 

* You can also install platform independent IDE versions like the "Enthought Python Distribution":"https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/" or "Anaconda":"https://www.continuum.io/downloads".

* For Windows users, you may consider a virtual machine like "VMware Ubuntu":"https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/details?productId=154&downloadGroup=WKST-716-WIN" 
* You can also go directly to the "python website":"https://www.python.org/downloads/" and download the Windows version. 

If you want to run a python program in terminal mode, simply write
!bc cppcod
python nameofprog.py 
!ec

!eblock




!split
=====     Optimization and profiling =====
!bblock

If you use C++ or Fortran without an IDE, you would compile as
!bc cppcod
c++  -c  mycode.cpp
c++  -o  mycode.exe  mycode.o
!ec
For Fortran replace with for example _gfortran_ or _ifort_.
This is what we call a flat compiler option and should be used when we develop the code.
It produces normally a very large and slow code when translated into machine instructions.
We use this option for debugging and for establishing the correct program output because
every operation is done precisely as the user specified it.

It is instructive to look up the compiler manual for further instructions by writing for example
!bc cppcod
man c++
!ec

!eblock
!split
===== More on optimization =====
!bblock
We have additional compiler options for optimization. These may include procedure inlining where 
performance may be improved, moving constants inside loops outside the loop, 
identify potential parallelism, include automatic vectorization or replace a division with a reciprocal
and a multiplication if this speeds up the code.
!bc cppcod
c++  -O3 -c  mycode.cpp
c++  -O3 -o  mycode.exe  mycode.o
!ec
This (other options are -O2 or -Ofast) is the recommended option. 


!eblock
!split
=====    Optimization and profiling  =====
!bblock
It is also useful to profile your program under the development stage.
You would then compile with 
!bc cppcod
c++  -pg -O3 -c  mycode.cpp
c++  -pg -O3 -o  mycode.exe  mycode.o
!ec
After you have run the code you can obtain the profiling information via
!bc cppcod
gprof mycode.exe >  ProfileOutput
!ec
When you have profiled properly your code, you must take out this option as it 
slows down performance.
For memory tests use "valgrind":"http://www.valgrind.org". An excellent environment for all these aspects, and much  more, is  "Qt creator":"https://www.qt.io/ide/".

!eblock

!split
=====    Optimization and debugging  =====
!bblock
Adding debugging options is a very useful alternative under the development stage of a program.
You would then compile with 
!bc cppcod
c++  -g -O0 -c  mycode.cpp
c++  -g -O0 -o  mycode.exe  mycode.o
!ec
This option generates debugging information allowing you to trace for example if an array is properly allocated. Some compilers work best with the no optimization option _-O0_. 
!eblock
!bblock Other optimization flags 
Depending on the compiler, one can add flags which generate code that catches integer overflow errors. 
The flag _-ftrapv_ does this for the CLANG compiler on OS X operating systems.

===== How do I run MPI on a PC/Laptop? MPI  =====
!bblock
To install MPI is rather easy on hardware running unix/linux as operating systems, follow simply the instructions from the "OpenMPI website":"https://www.open-mpi.org/". See also subsequent slides.
When you have made sure you have installed MPI on your PC/laptop, 
* Compile with mpicxx/mpic++ or mpif90
!bc cppcod
  # Compile and link
  mpic++ -O3 -o nameofprog.x nameofprog.cpp
  #  run code with for example 8 processes using mpirun/mpiexec
  mpiexec -n 8 ./nameofprog.x
!ec
!eblock

!split
===== Can I do it on my own PC/laptop? OpenMP installation =====
!bblock
If you wish to install MPI and OpenMP 
on your laptop/PC, we recommend the following:
* For OpenMP, the compile option _-fopenmp_ is included automatically in recent versions of the C++ compiler and Fortran compilers. For users of different Linux distributions, siply use the available C++ or Fortran compilers and add the above compiler instructions, see also code examples below. 
* For OS X users however, use for example 
!bc cppcod
  brew install clang-omp
!ec
!eblock



!split
===== Installing MPI =====
!bblock
For linux/ubuntu users, you need to install two packages (alternatively use the synaptic package manager)
!bc cppcod
  sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev
  sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin
!ec
For OS X users, install brew (after having installed xcode and gcc, needed for the 
gfortran compiler of openmpi) and then install with brew
!bc cppcod
   brew install openmpi
!ec
When running an executable (code.x), run as
!bc cppcod
  mpirun -n 10 ./code.x
!ec
where we indicate that we want  the number of processes to be 10.


!eblock


!split
===== Installing MPI and using Qt =====
!bblock
With openmpi installed, when using Qt, add to your .pro file the instructions "here":"http://dragly.org/2012/03/14/developing-mpi-applications-in-qt-creator/"

You may need to tell Qt where openmpi is stored.
