# CompPhysUTunis
This repository contains teaching material pertinent to an intensive course in Computational Physics 
at the University of Tunis in Tunisia 
from May  16 to May 20 2016.  The material has a focus 
on quantum mechanical problems with Variational Monte Carlo and diagonalization methods as the main topic. 
The quantum mechanical systems studied are electrons (fermions) 
in harmonic oscillator traps in two and three dimensions.
